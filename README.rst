Pepper contains a Python library and CLI scripts for accessing a remote
`salt-api`__ instance.

``pepperlib`` abstracts the HTTP calls to ``salt-api`` so existing Python
projects can easily integrate with a remote Salt installation just by
instantiating a class.

The ``pepper`` CLI script allows users to execute Salt commands from computers
that are external to computers running the ``salt-master`` or ``salt-minion``
daemons as though they were running Salt locally. The long-term goal is to add
additional CLI scripts maintain the same interface as Salt's own CLI scripts
(``salt``, ``salt-run``, ``salt-key``, etc).

It does not require any additional dependencies and runs on Python 2.5+ and
Python 3. (Python 3 support is new, please file an issue if you encounter
trouble.)

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: bash

    pip install salt-pepper

Usage
-----

You can run pepper using the script in %PYTHONHOME%/scripts/pepper (a pepper.cmd wrapper is provided for convenience to Windows users).

.. code-block:: bash

    export SALTAPI_USER=saltdev SALTAPI_PASS=saltdev SALTAPI_EAUTH=pam
    pepper '*' test.ping
    pepper '*' test.kwarg hello=dolly

Examples leveraging the runner client.

.. code-block:: bash

    pepper --client runner reactor.list
    pepper --client runner reactor.add event='test/provision/*' reactors='/srv/salt/state/reactor/test-provision.sls'

Configuration
-------------

You can configure pepper through the command line, using environment variables 
or in a configuration file ``$HOME/.pepperrc`` with the following syntax : 

.. code-block:: 

  [main]
  SALTAPI_URL=https://localhost:8000/
  SALTAPI_USER=saltdev
  SALTAPI_PASS=saltdev
  SALTAPI_EAUTH=pam

  # if you use client-side TLS certificates
  SALTAPI_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/ca-chain.cert.pem
  SALTAPI_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/client.cert.pem
  SALTAPI_CLIENT_CERT_KEY=/path/to/client.key.pem
